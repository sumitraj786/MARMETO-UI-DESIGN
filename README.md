This project is about creating a website where users can see different products for Men, Women, and Kids. The website has three tabs: Men, Women, and Kids. When you click on a tab, it shows products related to that category.
Each product is displayed as a card with a picture, a badge (like a special label), the product name, the brand (vendor) name, the price, and the original price for comparison.
The website also calculates and shows the discount percentage.
There is a button under each product card, but it's just for looks and doesn't do anything (a dummy button).
The website is designed to work well on different devices like phones, tablets, and computers.
It uses basic web technologies: HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for making things dynamic (like switching between tabs and calculating discounts).
The product information comes from a special file called JSON, and the website fetches this data to display the products.
